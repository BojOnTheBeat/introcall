Talk to a human.â„¢

## Team

## Description

A web service where you pay to talk to famous or talented people for 25 minutes.
Think of it is a professional Tinder, or Uber for networking. Anyone can
sign up to be a "consultant", and after being approved, you can earn an income
just by getting on the phone with people who want to talk to you.

The app will have to handle the profile creation, scheduling, voice/video
calling, and a rating/reputation system to make the Introleige process work
smoothly.

What makes Introleige different from 10k Coffees and other networking/social
websites is that is a *paid* service, intended to create income streams for
people from all walks of life.
